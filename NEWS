    * A new method has been added to be able to get the repository URI
      corresponding to a local path where the repository was checked
      out. (Carlos Garcia Campos)

Bug fixes:

    * Do not use git- commands, they are not available in recent git
      versions. (Carlos Garcia Campos)
    * Implement the special case module = '.' in the git backend to be
      able to clone the whole repository. (Carlos Garcia Campos)
    * Improve error handling when running commands providing
      the exceptions RepositoryCommandError and
      RepositoryCommandRunningError that wrap the Command.py
      exceptions. (Carlos Garcia Campos)
    * Several fixes and improvements when running commands included in
      the Command.py module. One important improvement is that
      standard and error output are not stored in memory anymore when
      the run() function is called with callbacks to handle such
      output, since it caused memory problems with commands that
      produces a lot of output like the log command. (Carlos Garcia
      Campos)
